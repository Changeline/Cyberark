# This file demonstrates how to securely store a password as an encrypted string using PowerShellâ€™s ConvertTo-SecureString cmdlet.
#
# NOTE:
# While this method provides basic encryption, it is not the most secure approach for production environments.
# For improved security, consider the following best practices:
#   - Restrict the allowed IP range for this user in the CyberArk Vault.
#   - Limit the time window during which the user can access the vault.
